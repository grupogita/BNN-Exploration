This repository presents Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) Exploration, a set of codes intended to generate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) with artificial intelligence algorithms and in particular the step-by-step to create a Neural Network that works with binary values. The data sets used for this exploration are: BOTNET2014[1] and CICIDS2017[2], wish are well known datasets within bening and attacks data.
