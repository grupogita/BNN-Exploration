This repository introduces the exploration of Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), which comprises a collection of code designed to construct Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) using artificial intelligence algorithms. The focus is on providing a comprehensive guide to creating a Neural Network that operates with binary values. The exploration employs two prominent datasets: BOTNET2014[1] and CICIDS2017[2], both of which are widely recognized for containing benign and attack-related data.
